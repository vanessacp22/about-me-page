    <h1 class="card-title">Hello, World!</h1>
    <p class="card-text"> I’m Vanessa Perez — a 21-year-old engineer-in-training with roots in San Diego and a vision that brought me to San Francisco. I moved here to build something real — a life defined by design, intention, and impact.<br>
    Before stepping into engineering, I spent three years managing sales floors and leading teams. I closed $245K in individual sales in one year, with my largest sale — $1,290.14 — made at a smaller retailer, in a language I didn’t even speak. That experience taught me that vision and adaptability can outperform any circumstanc e <br>Today, I teach at BODYROK, where discipline meets design, and I bring that same precision into my work as an engineer. <br>I’m currently preparing to transfer to a four-year university — with eyes on Cal Poly SLO, UC Santa Cruz, or UC Berkeley — to deepen my foundation before building what’s next.
    <br>Ultimately, I see myself founding my own company — a space where hardware, creativity, and human-centered design intersect.
    Outside the work, I care deeply about community and advocacy. I volunteer often and stand for immigrant rights, feminism, and LGBTQ+ equality — because progress doesn’t just happen; it’s engineered.
    I believe production value isn’t about polish alone — it’s about purpose. Every build, digital or physical, starts with vision and ends in precision</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Gratitute</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Everything I am building stands on the foundation my parents laid. My dad was a mechanic who left school early and came to the States young, chasing possibility through hard work and calloused hands. My mom arrived at fifteen, carrying more courage than comfort, and has made unimaginable sacrifices to help me move toward the future I’m shaping now.

My dad taught me that it’s not only okay to be a girl who gets her hands dirty — it’s powerful. He showed me that curiosity and grit can build bridges where there are none. My mom taught me resilience that doesn’t need an audience — strength that holds steady even when no one’s watching.

Their belief in me has made every ambition feel possible. Every project I take on — every system I build or space I step into — is guided by their lessons and their love. I’m not just building for myself; I’m building from them.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Causes & Communities</h5>
            <p class="card-text">I believe good design is socially conscious by default — it listens before it builds.
My work and volunteer efforts focus on immigrant rights, feminism, and LGBTQ+ equality. These communities remind me that innovation means nothing if it isn’t inclusive, and that progress starts with empathy before execution.

I’m deeply committed to using my platform — whether in engineering, education, or advocacy — to create access, visibility, and equity. From volunteering to mentoring, I strive to build spaces where representation and opportunity can coexist.

Because to me, being an engineer isn’t just about solving problems — it’s about designing systems that uplift people.</p>
